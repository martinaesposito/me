    "Descrizione": "An initiative organised by the Polimi Design System for Fuorisalone 2024 to reflect on the role of relationships and connections in contemporary society through a selection of design student projects.<br>The event took place in three locations in the city of Milan: Fabbrica del Vapore, Campus Bovisa Durando and Salone Satellite. The main venue was Fabbrica del Vapore, where more than 50 international schools presented their projects. At the same location, a series of talks and presentations took place throughout the week, which ended with a performance by Campo Teatrale.<br>I was responsible for the art direction of the entire exhibition: I designed the initiative's visual identity and coordinated its application across various artifacts, from project panels to the website and social media. The key visual was developed in code using P5.js, a Javascript library designed to make creative coding easy and accessible.",

    "Descrizione": "An interactive experience narrating the relationship between humans and parakeets in the online market through the symbolic element of the hand.<br>The project consists of an interactive installation that highlights the central role of humans in the presence of monk and ring-necked parakeets in Italian cities. Native to South America, these non-migratory birds were imported as pets due to their exotic charm. Some escaped captivity, forming urban colonies, while human demand fueled an online trade that continues today.<br>To investigate this phenomenon, 885 listings from 15 online platforms—including Facebook, Telegram, and Subito.it—were analyzed between November 1st and 5th, 2024. Among them, 114 listings featured photographs where, in addition to the parakeets for sale, human figures were visible through the presence of a hand.These listings were grouped into seven collections based on how the hand interacts with the parakeet. By comparing the images with their descriptions, the study explores the significance of these interactions, revealing how the birds are perceived and treated. The hand thus becomes the key symbol of the project, embodying the complex relationship between humans and parakeets. In the interactive experience, users can explore these collections and engage directly with the data through the movement of their own hand.<br>The experience consists of a web application built using three.js, and the Mediapipe Hand Landmark detection algorithm, a machine-learning solution developed by Google for hand recognition.<br>The project was showcased in a two-week exhibition at the MEET Digital Culture Centre in Milan.",

To find their soulmate the users have to identify which device is playing a sound each time they touch the screen. When the two persons meet they have to scan the respective devices to generate an artwork composed of the bits of communication sent during the experience. They can then save it as a memory of their match or look through all the other experiences collected in the gallery.",

Through the lens of the camera, the image of the person detaches from its identity and becomes a shape against a background, a part of a new bi-dimensional reality. By playing both in the studio and in the dark room, frames of different body parts were used to recreate iconic pictures of photographers such as Bill Brandt and Robert Mapplethorpe. The work proceeded by trial and error, exploring the possibility that the medium itself of photography could offer. The final prints were bound into a book while all the attempts and the experiments relative to the process were collected into a separate notebook.",

The enterprise has existed for more than forty years and it’s very proud of its traditional and natural methods of production. The visual identity was developed from a brand strategy expressed by three values: “terra terra”, “spalla spalla” and “pelle dura”. The main elements are linocut illustrations and ripped analogical pictures. Both these techniques have indeed the roughness and the simplicity characteristic of the cooperative's spirit. The texture typical of linocut prints is also applied to the logo and the typographic elements of the identity, for which a custom typeface was designed. Packagings and etiquettes, categorized by method of production, were made using the series of natural papers Crush Favini, produced by recycling agricultural waste. ",

While navigating the book, they must also attach the stickers of the design principles best displayed by the example in the proper spaces at the corner of the pages. To prove the effectiveness of street signs in conditions of rough visibility, sheets simulating weather conditions, such as fog or darkness, are placed at the end of the book.
